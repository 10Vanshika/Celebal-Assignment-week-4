Topic
Conduct an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis on a complex dataset. Focus on understanding data distributions, identifying missing values, detecting outliers, and uncovering relationships between variables. Utilize visualizations like histograms, box plots, and heatmaps to support your findings.

Assignment Description
This assignment performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, aiming to uncover key insights about passenger survival using visualizations, statistical summaries, and data preprocessing.

 Libraries Used
1. matplotlib.pyplot: For creating static, animated, and interactive plots.
2. pandas: For data manipulation and analysis (used later in the notebook).
3. seaborn: For creating advanced statistical visualizations with built-in themes and color palettes.
